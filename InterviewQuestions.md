1. **JSON Manipulation**

   **Task:** Given a JavaScript object with nested structures, write functions to:
   - Convert the object to a valid JSON string (using `JSON.stringify`).
   - Parse a given JSON string back into a JavaScript object (using `JSON.parse`).
   - Explain how you would handle circular references if they were present in the object.

   **Discussion:**
   - Explain the role of JSON in web development and data exchange.
   - Discuss error handling strategies when parsing invalid JSON.
   - Explore potential security concerns related to JSON parsing.

2. **Deep Copy**

   **Task:** Implement a function `deepCopy(obj)` that takes a JavaScript object (which can contain nested objects, arrays, and primitive types) and returns a deep copy of it. Ensure that the copy does not share any references with the original object.

   **Discussion:**
   - Explain the difference between shallow and deep copying.
   - Discuss the importance of deep copying in certain scenarios (e.g., when you need to modify a copy without affecting the original).
   - Talk about how you would handle circular references in the object.

3. **Data Filtering**

   **Task:** You are given an array of objects representing products. Each object has properties like `name`, `price`, `category`, etc. Write a function `filterProducts(products, criteria)` that takes the products array and a filter criteria object (e.g., `{ category: 'Electronics', price: { min: 50, max: 200 } }`) and returns a new array containing only the products that match the criteria.

   **Discussion:**
   - Discuss how you would make the filter function flexible to handle different criteria and operators.
   - Talk about how you would optimize the filter function for performance if dealing with a large dataset.

4. **Object Merging**

   **Task:** Write a function `mergeObjects(obj1, obj2)` that takes two objects as input and returns a new object that is the result of merging them. If there are conflicting keys, explain your strategy for resolving the conflict (e.g., override, concatenate, custom logic).

   **Discussion:**
   - Discuss the different strategies for merging objects and the trade-offs of each.
   - Talk about deep merging (merging nested objects) and its implications.
   - Discuss potential edge cases, such as merging objects with circular references.


5. **Debugging Challenge (10 minutes)**

   **Task:** Provide a short JavaScript code snippet with a subtle error (e.g., variable hoisting issue, incorrect use of `this`, async/await logic error). Ask Yuriy to identify the error, explain why it occurs, and propose a solution.

   **Discussion:**
   - Observe his debugging approach and how he communicates his thought process.
   - Ask about his preferred debugging tools and techniques.
